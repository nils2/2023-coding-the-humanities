    "#### How Indentation Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- All statements with the same distance from the left border belong of the same block of code. This is related to the _scope_ of your code. \n",
    "- Sub-blocks are more indented, while the block ends at the line less indented.\n",
    "- It is recommended to use **4 spaces** per indentation level. However, a tab character (`\\t`) can also be used. Often, you have a setting in your favorite editor that automatically translates tabs to 4 spaces. \n",
    "- When a statement is too long, it's good practice to avoid lines of code longer than 79 characters, it can be split with `\"\\\"` at the end of the line.\n",
    "- **Never mix** spaces and tabs in a single source file. This will raise an error when you try to execute the code, but is also very hard to spot by hand. To help you, you can set your text editor to display whitespace characters."

    "We now discussed the art of looping, to automate bits of your code and prevent repetition. If you know that you're going to use parts of your code more than once, you can make a function out of it. Functions are constructs that allows us to organize portions of code more than once in a program. The alternative way to obtain the same results without functions would be to copy the same portion of code every time it is needed. Organizing your code with functions makes it easier to split your problem into smaller subproblems.\n",
